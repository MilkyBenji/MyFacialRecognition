## **Project Overview**  

### **Introduction**  

**FacialRecognitionApp** is a Python-based facial recognition system that utilizes **OpenCV** for face detection and recognition. The system captures real-time video from a webcam, detects faces, and identifies known individuals using a trained **LBPH** model.

### **Features**  

- **Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition**: Uses OpenCV‚Äôs **Haar Cascade** for face detection.  
- **LBPH Face Recognition**: Implements the **Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH)** algorithm for recognizing faces.  
- **Confidence Score Display**: Shows how confident the model is about its recognition.  
- **Multiple User Support**: Recognizes multiple trained individuals.  
- **Live Webcam Feed**: Processes real-time video input.  

### **Technologies Used**  

- **Python**: Main programming language.  
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and recognition.  
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: Pre-trained model for detecting faces.  
- **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram)**: Algorithm for face recognition.

## **Motivation and Purpose**  

Facial recognition is widely used in security systems, authentication, and surveillance. The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience with **OpenCV**, **machine learning-based face recognition**, and **real-time image processing**.  

This project helped me:  

- Understand how facial recognition works.  
- Learn about different face detection & recognition techniques.  
- Implement a real-time facial recognition system from scratch.
